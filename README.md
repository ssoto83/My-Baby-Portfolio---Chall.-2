# My-Portfolio.Chall2
On this challenge I created my own portfolio for potential employers / User to review based on the requirements below:

The User Story:

AS AN employer

I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples

SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

I have included the details below:
* Profile picture and name.
* Links to sections about me, previous work and contact info.
* Included a live application larger in size then the rest and when clicked it will take the user to the deployed application.
* Tested the application for responsive layout.
